# About

I am a postdoc in [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org)'s group at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/). My current research focuses on foundation models for complex dynamical systems.  


**Short Bio:** I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/"> University of Tokyo </a>, where I obtained my ME and PhD degrees. I am also a visiting researcher at RIKEN AiP, KAIST and UTokyo. I am grateful to a long list of brilliant researchers and friends that have advised me through the years and (inexplicably) believe in my work: [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org), [Hajime Asama](http://www.robot.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/asamalab/Asama_page/top_a.html), [Atsushi Yamasita](http://www.robot.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamashita/profile-e.html), [Taiji Suzuki](http://ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/suzuki/), [Sho Sonoda](https://sites.google.com/view/shosonoda/home), [Jinkyoo Park](http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/?ckattempt=1), [Federico Califano](https://people.utwente.nl/f.califano) and [Claudio Melchiorri](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/claudio.melchiorri/en) among others.
